Task 1: Ordinal Number Spelling

You are given a positive number, $n.
Write a script to spell the ordinal number.

For example,

11 => eleventh
62 => sixty-second
99 => ninety-ninth

MY NOTES: ok, sounds pretty easy for n>0; let's arbitrarily deal with
n < 1000000 (although millions, billions etc would be pretty easy to add).
Let's do this via formwords(n) which converts (eg) n=17 to "seventeen" and
then use that to generate the final "seventeeth" (nth, ordinal, form) by
mucking about with the ending (and using some special case rules for English,
eg mapping one->first)

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for that).


Task 2: Unicode Sparkline

You are given a list of positive numbers, @n.

Write a script to print sparkline in Unicode for the given list of numbers.

MY NOTES: What on earth is "sparkline"?  Not a fan of Unicode either, forget it.
