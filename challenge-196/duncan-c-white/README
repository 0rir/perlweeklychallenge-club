Task 1: Special Integers

You are given a positive integer, $n > 0.

Write a script to print the count of all special integers between 1 and $n:
An integer is special when all of its digits are unique.

Example 1:

Input: $n = 15
Output: 14 as except 11 all other integers between 1 and 15 are spcial.

Example 2:

Input: $n = 35
Output: 32 as except 11, 22, 33 all others are special.

MY NOTES: very easy; use a freq hash

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for the translation)


Task 2: Most Frequent Even

You are given a list of numbers, @list.

Write a script to find most frequent even numbers in the list. In case you
get more than one even numbers then return the smallest even integer. For
all other case, return -1.

Example 1

Input: @list = (1,1,2,6,2)
Output: 2 as there are only 2 even numbers 2 and 6 and of those 2 appears the most.

Example 2

Input: @list = (1,3,5,7)
Output: -1 since no even numbers found in the list

Example 3

Input: @list = (6,4,4,6,1)
Output: 4 since there are only two even numbers 4 and 6. They both appears the equal number of times, so pick the smallest.

MY NOTES: very easy; select even numbers; build a freq hash, sort by freqs..

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-2.pl
into C (look in the C directory for the translation)
