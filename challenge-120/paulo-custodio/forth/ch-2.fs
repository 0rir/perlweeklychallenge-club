\ Challenge 120
\
\ TASK #2 › Clock Angle
\ Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
\ You are given time $T in the format hh:mm.
\
\ Write a script to find the smaller angle formed by the hands of an analog
\ clock at a given time.
\
\ HINT: A analog clock is divided up into 12 sectors. One sector represents 30
\ degree (360/12 = 30).
\
\ Example
\ Input: $T = '03:10'
\ Output: 35 degree
\
\ The distance between the 2 and the 3 on the clock is 30 degree.
\ For the 10 minutes i.e. 1/6 of an hour that have passed.
\ The hour hand has also moved 1/6 of the distance between the 3 and the 4,
\ which adds 5 degree (1/6 of 30).
\ The total measure of the angle is 35 degree.
\
\ Input: $T = '04:00'
\ Output: 120 degree
