Task 1: "Swap Odd/Even bits

You are given a positive integer $N less than or equal to 255.

Write a script to swap the odd positioned bit with even positioned bit
and print the decimal equivalent of the new binary representation.

Example

  Input: $N = 101
  Output: 154

  Binary representation of the given number is 01 10 01 01.
  The new binary representation after the odd/even swap is 10 01 10 10.
  The decimal equivalent of 10011010 is 154.

  Input: $N = 18
  Output: 33

  Binary representation of the given number is 00 01 00 10.
  The new binary representation after the odd/even swap is 00 10 00 01.
  The decimal equivalent of 100001 is 33.
"

My notes: trivial again.


Task 2: "Clock Angle

You are given time $T in the format hh:mm.

Write a script to find the smaller angle formed by the hands of an analog
clock at a given time.

HINT: A analog clock is divided up into 12 sectors. One sector represents
30 degree (360/12 = 30).

Example

  Input: $T = '03:10'
  Output: 35 degree

  The distance between the 2 and the 3 on the clock is 30 degree.
  For the 10 minutes i.e. 1/6 of an hour that have passed.
  The hour hand has also moved 1/6 of the distance between the 3 and the 4,
  which adds 5 degree (1/6 of 30).
  The total measure of the angle is 35 degree.

  Input: $T = '04:00'
  Output: 120 degree
"

My notes: sounds pretty easy.
