Task 1: First Unique Character

You are given a string, $s.
Write a script to find out the first unique character in the given string
and print its index (0-based).

Example 1

Input: $s = "Perl Weekly Challenge"
Output: 0 as 'P' is the first unique character

Example 2

Input: $s = "Long Live Perl"
Output: 1 as 'o' is the first unique character

MY NOTES: ok, sounds extremely easy, first pass: build a freq hash (a bag),
second pass: sequence through the string, print index of first char
with freq 1.  There is one case where the behaviour is undefined: what if
there are no unique characters in the string? I've decided to produce pos -1
in that case.

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for that).


Task 2: Trim List

You are given list of numbers, @n and an integer $i.
Write a script to trim the given list where element is less than or
equal to the given integer.

Example 1

Input: @n = (1,4,2,3,5) and $i = 3
Output: (4,5)

Example 2

Input: @n = (9,0,6,2,3,8,5) and $i = 4
Output: (9,6,8,5)

MY NOTES: also looks incredibly easy, basically grep { $_ >= $i }.
Just to bulk the task up a little, I allowed the input list to be
spread across multiple arguments, each of which can either store a
simple +ve int, or a comma-separated list of one or more +ve ints.

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-2.pl
into C (look in the C directory for that).
