# Task #2
# Write a script for URL normalization based on rfc3986. This task was shared by
# Anonymous Contributor.
#
# According to Wikipedia, URL normalization is the process by which URLs are
# modified and standardized in a consistent manner. The goal of the
# normalization process is to transform a URL into a normalized URL so it is
# possible to determine if two syntactically different URLs may be equivalent.
