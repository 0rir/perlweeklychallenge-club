Task 1: Digital Clock

You are given time in the format hh:mm with one missing digit.

Write a script to find the highest digit between 0-9 that makes it valid time.

Example 1

Input: $time = '?5:00'
Output: 1

Since 05:00 and 15:00 are valid time and no other digits can fit in the
missing place.

Example 2

Input: $time = '?3:00'
Output: 2

Example 3

Input: $time = '1?:00'
Output: 9

Example 4

Input: $time = '2?:00'
Output: 3

Example 5

Input: $time = '12:?5'
Output: 5

Example 6

Input: $time =  '12:5?'
Output: 9

MY NOTES: very easy

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for the translation)


Task 2: Frequency Equalizer

You are given a string made of alphabetic characters only, a-z.

Write a script to determine whether removing only one character can make
the frequency of the remaining characters the same.

Example 1:

Input: $s = 'abbc'
Output: 1 since removing one alphabet 'b' will give us 'abc' where each alphabet frequency is the same.

Example 2:

Input: $s = 'xyzyyxz'
Output: 1 since removing 'y' will give us 'xzyyxz'.

Example 3:

Input: $s = 'xzxz'
Output: 0 since removing any one alphabet would not give us string with same frequency alphabet.

MY NOTES: sounds pretty easy.
