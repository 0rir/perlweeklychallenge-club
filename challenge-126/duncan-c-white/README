Task 1: "Count Numbers

You are given a positive integer $N.

Write a script to print count of numbers from 1 to $N that don't
contain digit 1.

Example

Input: $N = 15
Output: 8

    There are 8 numbers between 1 and 15 that don't contain digit 1.
    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Input: $N = 25
Output: 13

    There are 13 numbers between 1 and 25 that don't contain digit 1.
    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25.
"

My notes: very easy.  Let's produce the "There are ..." output if --debug
is given, the terse output otherwise.


Task 2: "Minesweeper Game

You are given a rectangle with points marked with either x or *.
Please consider the x as a land mine (DCW adds: and a * as a non-landmine).

Write a script to print a rectangle with numbers and x as in the
Minesweeper game.

A number in a square of the minesweeper game indicates the number
of mines within the neighbouring squares (usually 8), also implies
that there are no bombs on that square.

Example

Input:
    x * * * x * x x x x
    * * * * * * * * * x
    * * * * x * x * x *
    * * * x x * * * * *
    x * * * x * * * * x

Output:
    x 1 0 1 x 2 x x x x
    1 1 0 2 2 4 3 5 5 x
    0 0 1 3 x 3 x 2 x 2
    1 1 1 x x 4 1 2 2 2
    x 1 1 3 x 2 0 0 1 x
"

My notes: also looks pretty easy.  It's not the WHOLE minesweeper game,
just the "work out what the finished puzzle looks like"
