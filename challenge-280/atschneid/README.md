# Perl Weeklky Challenge 280

**Challenge 280 solutions by Andrew Schneider**

[PWC 280](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-280/)

Unlike past weeks I have only done this Perl Weekly Challenge in Perl. How novel!

I don't fell like I have enough to say about this challenge to make a pseudo-redame-blog post about it.

The solutions in Perl came pretty easily, they played to Perl's strengths for sure. I would have struggled a bit solving solving these in my usual menagerie of programming languages.

Thanks for the challenges! See you next week.
