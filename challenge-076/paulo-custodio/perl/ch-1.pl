# TASK #1 â€º Prime Sum
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# Reviewed by: Ryan Thompson
# You are given a number $N. Write a script to find the minimum number of prime numbers required, whose summation gives you $N.
# 
# For the sake of this task, please assume 1 is not a prime number.
# 
# Example:
# Input:
#     $N = 9
# 
# Ouput:
#     2 as sum of 2 prime numbers i.e. 2 and 7 is same as the input number.
#     2 + 7 = 9.
