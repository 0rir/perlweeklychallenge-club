# TASK #2 â€º Word Search
# Submitted by: Neil Bowers
# Reviewed by: Ryan Thompson
#
# Write a script that takes two file names. The first file would
# contain word search grid as shown below. The second file contains
# list of words, one word per line. You could even use local
# dictionary file.
#
# Print out a list of all words seen on the grid, looking both
# orthogonally and diagonally, backwards as well as forwards.
#
# Output
# Found 54 words of length 5 or more when checked against the local
# dictionary. You may or may not get the same result but that is fine.
