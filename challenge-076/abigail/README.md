## [Prime Sum](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-076/#TASK1)

You are given a number `$N`. Write a script to find the minimum number
of prime numbers required, whose summation gives you `$N`.

For the sake of this task, please assume `1` is not a prime number.

### Example
~~~~
Input:
    $N = 9

Ouput:
    2 as sum of 2 prime numbers i.e. 2 and 7 is same as the input number.
    2 + 7 = 9.
