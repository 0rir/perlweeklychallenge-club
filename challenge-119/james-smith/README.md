# Task 1 - Swap Nibbles

***You are given a positive integer `$N`. Write a script to swap the two nibbles of the binary representation of the given number and print the decimal number of the new binary representation.(((

## The solution

# Task 2 - Sequence without 1-on-1

*** Write a script to generate sequence starting at 1. Consider the increasing sequence of integers which contain only 1’s, 2’s and 3’s, and do not have any doublets of 1’s like below. Please accept a positive integer `$N` and print the `$N`th term in the generated sequence.

```
1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, 121, 122, 123, 131, ...
```
