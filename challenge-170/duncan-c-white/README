TASK 1: Primorial Numbers

Write a script to generate first 10 Primorial Numbers:
Primorial numbers are those formed by multiplying successive prime numbers.

For example,

P(0) = 1    (1)
P(1) = 2    (1x2)
P(2) = 6    (1x2x3)
P(3) = 30   (1x2x3x5)

MY NOTES: ok, sounds easy, but I'm getting very bored of
"tasks to do with Number Theory and (especially) Primes".

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for that).


Task 2: Kronecker Product

You are given 2 matrices.

Write a script to implement Kronecker Product on the given 2 matrices.

For more information, please refer to the wikipedia page
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product

For example,

A = [ 1 2 ]
    [ 3 4 ]

B = [ 5 6 ]
    [ 7 8 ]

A x B = [ 1 x [ 5 6 ]   2 x [ 5 6 ] ]
        [     [ 7 8 ]       [ 7 8 ] ]
        [ 3 x [ 5 6 ]   4 x [ 5 6 ] ]
        [     [ 7 8 ]       [ 7 8 ] ]

      = [ 1x5 1x6 2x5 2x6 ]
        [ 1x7 1x8 2x7 2x8 ]
        [ 3x5 3x6 4x5 4x6 ]
        [ 3x7 3x8 4x7 4x8 ]

      = [  5  6 10 12 ]
        [  7  8 14 16 ]
        [ 15 18 20 24 ]
        [ 21 24 28 32 ]

MY NOTES: Ok, at least it has nothing to do with prime numbers:-)
I note in the Wikipedia page the useful formula:
(A x B)ij = Ai/p,j/q * Bi%p,j%q    [where B is of size p x q]

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-2.pl
into C (look in the C directory for that).
