# Perl Weekly Challenge Club

This is the central repository for the members of **Perl Weekly Challenge**. The members can submit the solution to the challenge each week under version control.

## How to contribute?
Just submit Pull Request with your solutions.

First find out the latest challenge folder, more likely the highest numbered folder is the latest challenge folder e.g. challenge-002. If you are an existing member, you would probably find a folder by your name. For example, if your name is "Job Blog" then there would be a folder called "joe-blog". Under your named folder, you would find a file **README**. Depending on your choice of language, you should create a folder here e.g. **perl5** for Perl 5 and **perl6** for Perl 6. Inside each of these folders you can save your solutions. If it is perl5 script for challenge 1 then call it **ch-1.pl**. Similarly if it is perl5 script for challenge 2 then call it **ch-2.pl**. For perl6 solutions, call it **ch-1.p6** and **ch-2.p6** respectively. And if you are writing one-liner then call it **ch-1.sh** or **ch-2.sh**. If you are contributing for the first time, please create your named folder as described above. Also let us know what name you would like us to use?

In case you have created a blog about your solutions, then create a file called **blog.txt** and add the link to it.
