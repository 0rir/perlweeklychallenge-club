Task 1: "Isomorphic Strings

You are given two strings $A and $B.

Write a script to check if the given strings are Isomorphic. Print 1 if they are otherwise 0.
(Isomorphic means: same length, and with a 1-1 mapping between distinct chars in $A and those in $B).

Example 1:

	Input: $A = "abc"; $B = "xyz"
	Output: 1

Example 2:

	Input: $A = "abb"; $B = "xyy"
	Output: 1

Example 3:

	Input: $A = "sum"; $B = "add"
	Output: 0
"

My notes: nice!


Task 2: "Insert Interval

You are given a set of sorted non-overlapping intervals and a new interval.

Write a script to merge the new interval to the given set of intervals.

Example 1:
	Input $S = (1,4), (8,10); $N = (2,6)
	Output: (1,6), (8,10)

Example 2:
	Input $S = (1,2), (3,7), (8,10); $N = (5,8)
	Output: (1,2), (3,10)

Example 3:
	Input $S = (1,5), (7,9); $N = (10,11)
	Output: (1,5), (7,9), (10,11)

My notes: interesting. Sounds familiar.
