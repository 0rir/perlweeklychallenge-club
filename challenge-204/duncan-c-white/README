Task 1: Special Quadruplets

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to find out the total special quadruplets for the given array.
Special Quadruplets are such that satisfies the following 2 rules.
1) nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] == nums[d]
2) a < b < c < d

Example 1

  Input: @nums = (1,2,3,6)
  Output: 1

  Since the only special quadruplets found is $nums[0] + $nums[1] + $nums[2] == $nums[3].

Example 2

  Input: @nums = (1,1,1,3,5)
  Output: 4

  $nums[0] + $nums[1] + $nums[2] == $nums[3]
  $nums[0] + $nums[1] + $nums[3] == $nums[4]
  $nums[0] + $nums[2] + $nums[3] == $nums[4]
  $nums[1] + $nums[2] + $nums[3] == $nums[4]

Example 3

  Input: @nums = (3,3,6,4,5)
  Output: 0

MY NOTES: seems pretty easy. condition (2) implies 4 for loops, a, b, c and d

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for the translation)


Task 2: Copy Directory
Submitted by: Julien Fiegehenn

You are given path to two folders, $source and $target.

Write a script that recursively copy the directory from $source to
$target except any files.

Example

  Input: $source = '/a/b/c' and $target = '/x/y'

  Source directory structure:

|___ a
|    |___ b
|         |___ c
|              |___ 1
|              |    |___ 1.txt
|              |___ 2
|              |    |___ 2.txt
|              |___ 3
|              |    |___ 3.txt
|              |___ 4
|              |___ 5
|              |    |___ 5.txt

Target directory structure:

|___ x
|    |___ y

Expected Result:

|___ x
|    |___ y
|         |___ 1
|         |___ 2
|         |___ 3
|         |___ 4
|         |___ 5


MY NOTES: also quite easy, especially using File::Find.
