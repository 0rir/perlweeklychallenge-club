Thought I'd also have a go at translating ch-1.pl and ch-2.pl into C..

Both C versions produce near-identical (non-debugging and even debugging)
output to the Perl originals.

The C translation of ch-2.pl was quite tricky to write, mainly on storage
allocation (as usual), although I found a neat (slightly cheaty?)
way of doing it.  specifically: I create a 1d-array of all the elements,
and then I print it out as if it were an RxC matrix..

These C versions use most of my regular support modules:
- a command-line argument processing module args.[ch],
- a csvlist-of-int parsing module parseints.[ch], and
- an int-array printing module printarray.[ch].
