# The Weekly Challenge 204

You can find more information about this weeks, and previous weeks challenges at:

  https://theweeklychallenge.org/

If you are not already doing the challenge - it is a good place to practise your
**perl** or **raku**. If it is not **perl** or **raku** you develop in - you can
submit solutions in whichever language you feel comfortable with.

You can find the solutions here on github at:

# Task 1: Monotonic Array

***You are given an array of integers. Write a script to find out if the given array is Monotonic. Print 1 if it is otherwise 0. An array is Monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or decreasing.***

## Solution

We loop through the array - firstly trying to find if the string is increasing or decreasing.

To do so we collect ths sign of the difference between successive numbers UNTIL we find a non-zero value.. We then see if all subsequence differences have the same sign (or 0)....

```perl
sub monotonic {
  my ( $delta, $tmp ) = ( shift ) <=> ( my $next = shift );
  ( $tmp = $next<=>$_[0] ) && ( $delta||=$tmp ) != $tmp ? ( return 0 ) : ( $next = shift ) while @_;
  1;
}
```

# Task 2: Reshape Matrix

***You are given a matrix (m x n) and two integers (r) and (c). Write a script to reshape the given matrix in form (r x c) with the original value in the given matrix. If you canâ€™t reshape print 0.***

```perl
sub reshape {
  my($m,$r,$c) = @_;
  return 0 unless @{$m}*@{$m->[0]} == $r * $c;
  my @t = map { @{$_} } @{$m};
  [ map { [ splice @t, 0, $c ] } 1..$r ];
}
```

Pass 2...

```perl
sub reshape2 {
  my($m,$r,$c) = @_;
  my $R=@{$m}; my $C = @{$m->[0]};
  return 0 unless (my $R=@{$m}) * (my $C=@{$m->[0]}) == $r * $c;
  my($x,$y,$res)=(0,0);
  for my $i (1..$r) {
    my $row = [];
    my $to_push = $c;
    while( $to_push ) {
      my $t = $to_push+$x<$C?$to_push+$x:$C;
      push @{$row},@{$m->[$y]}[$x..$t-1];
      $to_push -= $t-$x;
      $t==$C ? ($y++,$x=0) : ($x=$t);
    }
    push @{$res},$row;
  }
  $res;
}
```
