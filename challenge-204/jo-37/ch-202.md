# Sequential adjacent consecutive second-next neighbors

**Preface:**
I wrote this text *after* I submitted my solution to the week 202's challenge *and* I looked throught  all other solutions that were submitted so far.

I was surprised to see other interpretations of task 1 that I hadn't thought about. To restate:

> Write a script to print 1 if there are THREE consecutive odds in the given array otherwise print 0.

Sounds clear: three consecutive odds. But wait: What is the meaning of "consecutive"?
I interpreted this as "three odd numbers consecutive in the list".  Another valid interpretation would be: "three consecutive odd numbers contained in the list".  Something completely different!

An example for my interpretation:

    2, 4, 9, 3, 7, 22
has three consecutive odds: 9, 3, 7.

On the other hand:

    4, 9, 2, 11, 6, 7
has three consecutive odds: 7, 9, 11.

I refuse to interpret the task as: three consecutive consecutive odds, i.e.

    2, 3, 5, 7, 8

regarding as valid but refusing

    7, 2, 5, 8, 3

*and*

    2, 7, 3, 5, 8
