Solutions generated by ChatGPT.

The solutions are based on the description and the examples that the Weekly Challenge offers. It was sent to the chat as they are published on the website without any modifications.

The solution located in this directory are the first versions that ChatGPT generated. The code is taken as soon as it compiles and gives correct results. Optimised versions with a more natural Raku syntax are placed at ../ash. All those were also done in a dialogue with the machine with some hints from a human.
