Task 1: Sequence Number

You are given list of strings in the format aa9999 i.e. first 2 characters
can be anything 'a-z' followed by 4 digits '0-9'.
Write a script to replace the first two characters with sequence starting
with '00', '01', '02' etc.

Example 1

	Input: @list = ( 'ab1234', 'cd5678', 'ef1342')
	Output: ('001234', '015678', '021342')

Example 2

	Input: @list = ( 'pq1122', 'rs3334')
	Output: ('001122', '013334')

MY NOTES: nice and easy. Trivial in fact.

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at implementing ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for that).


Task 2: Split Array

You are given list of strings containing 0-9 and a-z separated by space only.
Write a script to split the data into two arrays, one for integers and
one for alphabets only.

Example 1

	Input: @list = ( 'a 1 2 b 0', '3 c 4 d')
	Output: [[1,2,0], [3,4]] and [['a','b'], ['c','d']]

Example 2

	Input: @list = ( '1 2', 'p q r', 's 3', '4 5 t')
	Output: [[1,2], [3], [4,5]] and [['p','q','r'], ['s'], ['t']]

MY NOTES: Also seems pretty simple.

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-2.pl
into C (look in the C directory for that).
