# Challenge #2
#
# Write a script that finds the common directory path, given a
# collection of paths and directory separator. For example, if the
# following paths are supplied.
#
# ```
# /a/b/c/d
# /a/b/cd
# /a/b/cc
# /a/b/c/d/e
# ```
#
# and the path separator is `/`. Your script should return `/a/b` as common
# directory path.
