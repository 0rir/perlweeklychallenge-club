Task 1: "Maximum Gap

You are given an array of integers @N.

Write a script to display the maximum difference between two successive
elements once the array is sorted.
If the array contains only 1 element then display 0.

Example

	Input: @N = (2, 9, 3, 5)
	Output: 4

	Input: @N = (1, 3, 8, 2, 0)
	Output: 5

	Input: @N = (5)
	Output: 0
"

My notes: should be easy.


Task 2: "Decimal String

You are given numerator and denominator i.e. $N and $D.

Write a script to convert the fraction into decimal string. If the
fractional part is recurring then put it in parenthesis.

Example

	Input: $N = 1, $D = 3
	Output: "0.(3)"

	Input: $N = 1, $D = 2
	Output: "0.5"

	Input: $N = 5, $D = 66
	Output: "0.0(75)"
"

My notes: the recurring bit is of course the core of this problem.
How to do it?  Refreshing my memory with some examples of long
division (sad), I realise that if we've seen the remainder before
the recurring part is from where we saw that remainder before to
the end of the digits produced.
