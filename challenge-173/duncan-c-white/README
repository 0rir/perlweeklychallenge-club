Task 1: Abundant Number

Write a script to generate first 20 Abundant Odd Numbers.

According to wikipedia: A number n for which the sum of proper divisors
(divisors from 1 but less than n) s(n) > n.

For example, 945 is the first Abundant Odd Number.

Sum of divisors:
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 15 + 21 + 27 + 35 + 45 + 63 + 105 + 135 + 189 + 315 = 975

MY NOTES: ok, sounds easy, and at least it's nowt to do with Primes:-)

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for that).


Task 2: First-class Function

Create sub compose($f, $g) which takes in two parameters $f and $g as
subroutine refs and returns subroutine ref i.e. compose($f, $g)->($x)
= $f->($g->($x))

e.g.

$f = (one or more parameters function)
$g = (one or more parameters function)

$h = compose($f, $g)
$f->($g->($x,$y, ..)) == $h->($x, $y, ..) for any $x, $y, ...

MY NOTES: An interesting question at last.  Think it's quite easy..
