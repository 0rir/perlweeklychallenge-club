Task 1: "Average of Stream

You are given a stream of numbers, @N.

Write a script to print the average of the stream at every point.

Example

Input: @N = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, ...)
Output:      10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, ...

Average of first number is 10.
Average of first 2 numbers (10+20)/2 = 15
Average of first 3 numbers (10+20+30)/3 = 20
Average of first 4 numbers (10+20+30+40)/4 = 25 and so on.
"

My notes: sounds quite simple, just requires a running total.


Task 2: "Basketball Points

You are given a score $S.

You can win basketball points e.g. 1 point, 2 points and 3 points.

Write a script to find out the different ways you can score $S.

Example

Input: $S = 4
Output: 1 1 1 1
        1 1 2
        1 2 1
        1 3
        2 1 1
        2 2
        3 1

Input: $S = 5
Output: 1 1 1 1 1
        1 1 1 2
        1 1 2 1
        1 1 3
        1 2 1 1
        1 2 2
        1 3 1
        2 1 1 1
        2 1 2
        2 2 1
        2 3
        3 1 1
"

My notes: Assuming I'm understanding it right, all combinations of
removing 1, 2 or 3 from N repeatedly.  Easyish (recursive).
NOTE: surely the $S = 5 example omits one last solution "3 2"?
