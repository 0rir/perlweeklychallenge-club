' Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
' You are given a positive integer $N.
' 
' Write a script to sum GCD of all possible unique pairs between 1 and $N.

Function gcd(a as Long, b as Long) as Long
	If a=0 Then
		gcd = b
	Else
		gcd = gcd(b Mod a, a)
	EndIf
End Function

Function sum_gcd(n as Long) as Long
	Dim sum as Long, a as Long, b as Long
	For a=1 to n-1
		For b=a+1 to n
			sum = sum + gcd(a,b)
		Next b
	Next a
	sum_gcd = sum
End Function

dim n as Long
n = Val(Command(1))
Print sum_gcd(n)
