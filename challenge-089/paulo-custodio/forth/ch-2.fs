\ TASK #2 › Magical Matrix
\ Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
\ Write a script to display matrix as below with numbers 1 - 9. 
\ Please make sure numbers are used once.
\ 
\ [ a b c ]
\ [ d e f ]
\ [ g h i ]
\ So that it satisfies the following:
\ 
\ a + b + c = 15
\ d + e + f = 15
\ g + h + i = 15
\ a + d + g = 15
\ b + e + h = 15
\ c + f + i = 15
\ a + e + i = 15
\ c + e + g = 15

\ Test a brute-force method; for a better algorithm see my perl solution.
