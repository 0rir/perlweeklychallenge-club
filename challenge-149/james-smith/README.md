# Perl Weekly Challenge #149

You can find more information about this weeks, and previous weeks challenges at:

  https://theweeklychallenge.org/

If you are not already doing the challenge - it is a good place to practise your
**perl** or **raku**. If it is not **perl** or **raku** you develop in - you can
submit solutions in whichever language you feel comfortable with.

You can find the solutions here on github at:

# Challenge 1 - Fibonacci Digit Sum

***Given an input $N, generate the first $N numbers for which the sum of their digits is a Fibonacci number.***

## The solution

```perl
for( my($n,$ds,$i,$fa,$fb,%fib)=(@ARGV?$ARGV[0]:20,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1);
     $n; $i++,$ds=0 ) {                                 ## 1
  $ds+=$_ foreach split //,$i;                          ## 2
  ($fib{$fa+$fb},$fa,$fb)=(1,$fb,$fa+$fb) if $ds > $fb; ## 3
  (say $i)**$n-- if exists $fib{$ds};                   ## 4
}
```

**Notes:**

 * Line 1 - We initialise everything inside the for loop
   * `$n` is the number to print (and is based on what is passed at the command line)
   * `$ds` is the digit sum (Note we reset it everytime through the loop in the incremement part of the loop
   * `$i`  current value being considered
   * `$fa` & `$fb` - the highest two fibonacci numbers 
   * `%fib` hash whose keys are fibonacci numbers
 * Line 2 - Computes the digit sum by splitting number on `//` I split into 1 character blocks
 * Line 3 - Expand the fibonacci hash by 1 if the digit sum is greater than the highest fibonnaci number {we don't need to loop this as the digit sum of `$n+1` can only be at most 1 higher than that for `$n`. Note we just update $fb and $fa in this line
 * Line 4 - Check to see if the digit sum exists, print and decrement counter - and return to the start of the loop.

# Challenge 2 - Largest Square

***Given a number base, derive the largest perfect square with no repeated digits and return it as a string. (For base>10, use ‘A’..‘Z’.)***

## The solution

```perl
sub biggest_perfect_square {
  my $nt = my $m = (my $n = shift) -1;                       ## 1
  $m=$m*$n+$nt while $nt--;                                  ## 2
  O: for( my $t = int sqrt $m; ; $t -- ) {                   ## 3
    my ($q,%seen) = $t**2;                                   ## 4
    $seen{$q%$n}++?(next O):($q=int($q/$n)) while $q;        ## 5
    return $t;                                               ## 6
  }
}
```

**Notes:**

 * Line 1 - initialise `$n` the base we are looking at, and variables to compute the maximum possible square
 * Line 2 - Compute the maximum possible pandigital value for the given base - it is the digits in descending order *e.g.* `BA9876543210` for `$n=12`
 * Line 3 - Here we just loop from the maximum possible square (sqrt of max pandigital number rounded down). Loop will finish for all +be bases as `1` is a solution in all cases.
 * Line 4/5 - We loop through all digits to see if we have already seen the digit if so we skip to the next value of `$t` by using `next` with a label to not just out of this loop but to go to the next element of the outer loop.
 * If we get through the while loop we have a value - and it must be the highest.

## Results

The values for each value of $N are given below up to (base 15) - the largest value for which we can compute in perl's 64-bit architecture.

You will note that most time is taken where `$n` is 13. You will note that for `$n` in `3`, `5`, `13` there are no pan-digital solutions so we have to loop through all the 13 digit numbers and reach the 12 digit numbers before we find a solution. *97.6%* of the checks for matching digits are in the case where `$n` is 13 (approximately 97% of the time in the code).
