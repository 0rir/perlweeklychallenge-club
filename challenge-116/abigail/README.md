> You are given a number `$N` >= `10`.
> 
> Write a script to split the given number such that the difference
> between two consecutive numbers is always 1 and it shouldn't have
> leading `0`.
> 
> Print the given number if it impossible to split the number.

### Example
~~~~
Input: $N = 1234
Output: 1,2,3,4

Input: $N = 91011
Output: 9,10,11

Input: $N = 10203
Output: 10203 as it is impossible to split satisfying the conditions.

> You are given a number $N >= 10.
>
> Write a script to find out if the given number `$N` is such that
> sum of squares of all digits is a perfect square.
> Print `1` if it is otherwise `0`.

### Examples
~~~~
Input: $N = 34
Ouput: 1 as 3^2 + 4^2 => 9 + 16 => 25 => 5^2

Input: $N = 50
Output: 1 as 5^2 + 0^2 => 25 + 0 => 25 => 5^2

Input: $N = 52
Output: 0 as 5^2 + 2^2 => 25 + 4 => 29
