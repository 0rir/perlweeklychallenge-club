    TASK #2 â€º Sum of Squares
    Submitted by: Mohammad Meraj Zia
    You are given a number $N >= 10.

    Write a script to find out if the given number $N is such that sum of squares of all digits is a perfect square. Print 1 if it is otherwise 0.

    Example
    Input: $N = 34
    Ouput: 1 as 3^2 + 4^2 => 9 + 16 => 25 => 5^2

    Input: $N = 50
    Output: 1 as 5^2 + 0^2 => 25 + 0 => 25 => 5^2

    Input: $N = 52
    Output: 0 as 5^2 + 2^2 => 25 + 4 => 29

import math

input = '34'

for charac in input:
    suma += int(charac)**2

if (math.sqrt(suma)** 2) == suma:
    print("Ouput: 1")
else:
    print("Ouput: 0")
