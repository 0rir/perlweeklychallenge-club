=prompt
You are given a number $N >= 10. Write a script to split the given number such that the difference between two consecutive numbers is always 1 and it shouldnâ€™t have leading 0.
Print the given number if it impossible to split the number.

Example Input: $N = 1234 Output: 1,2,3,4
Input: $N = 91011 Output: 9,10,11
Input: $N = 10203 Output: 10203 as it is impossible to split satisfying the conditions.
