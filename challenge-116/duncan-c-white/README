Task 1: "Number Sequence

You are given a number $N >= 10.

Write a script to split the given number such that the difference between
two consecutive numbers is always 1 and it shouldn't have leading 0.

Print the given number if it impossible to split the number.

Example

  Input: $N = 1234
  Output: 1,2,3,4

  Input: $N = 91011
  Output: 9,10,11

  Input: $N = 10203
  Output: 10203 as it is impossible to split satisfying the conditions.
"

My notes: seems pretty easy.  Only question is the initial number's width - try all possible widths.

Task 2: "Sum of Squares

You are given a number $N >= 10.

Write a script to find out if the given number $N is such that sum of
squares of all digits is a perfect square. Print 1 if it is otherwise 0.

Example

  Input: $N = 34
  Ouput: 1 as 3^2 + 4^2 => 9 + 16 => 25 => 5^2

  Input: $N = 50
  Output: 1 as 5^2 + 0^2 => 25 + 0 => 25 => 5^2
  
  Input: $N = 52
  Output: 0 as 5^2 + 2^2 => 25 + 4 => 29
"

My notes: should be easy.
