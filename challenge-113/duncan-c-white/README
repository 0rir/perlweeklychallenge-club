Task 1: "Canonical Path

You are given a string path, starting with a slash '/'.

Write a script to convert the given absolute path to the simplified canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system:

- A period '.' refers to the current directory
- A double period '..' refers to the directory up a level
- Multiple consecutive slashes ('//') are treated as a single slash '/'

The canonical path format:

- The path starts with a single slash '/'.
- Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
- The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
- The path only contains the directories on the path from the root
  directory to the target file or directory

Example

Input: "/a/"
Output: "/a"

Input: "/a/b//c/"
Output: "/a/b/c"

Input: "/a/b/c/../.."
Output: "/a"
"

My notes: ok, I like this.  Pretty straightforward, but a nice practical problem.


Task 2: "Climb Stairs

You are given $n steps to climb

Write a script to find out the distinct ways to climb to the top. You
are allowed to climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

Example

Input: $n = 3
Output: 3

    Option 1: 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    Option 2: 1 step + 2 steps
    Option 3: 2 steps + 1 step

Input: $n = 4
Output: 5

    Option 1: 1 step + 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    Option 2: 1 step + 1 step + 2 steps
    Option 3: 2 steps + 1 step + 1 step
    Option 4: 1 step + 2 steps + 1 step
    Option 5: 2 steps + 2 steps
"

My notes: looks pretty straightforward, although may not generate the options
in the same order.
