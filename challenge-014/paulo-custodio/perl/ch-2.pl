# Challenge #2
# Using only the official postal (2-letter) abbreviations for the 50 U.S.
# states, write a script to find the longest English word you can spell? Here
# is the list of U.S. states abbreviations as per wikipedia page. This challenge
# was proposed by team member Neil Bowers.
# 
# For example,
# Pennsylvania + Connecticut = PACT
# Wisconsin + North Dakota = WIND
# Maine + Alabama = MEAL
# California + Louisiana + Massachusetts + Rhode Island = Calamari
