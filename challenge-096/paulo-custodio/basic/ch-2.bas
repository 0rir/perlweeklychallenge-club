' TASK #2 â€º Edit Distance
' Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
' You are given two strings $S1 and $S2.
'
' Write a script to find out the minimum operations required to convert $S1
' into $S2. The operations can be insert, remove or replace a character. Please
' check out Wikipedia page for more information.
'
' Example 1:
' Input: $S1 = "kitten"; $S2 = "sitting"
' Output: 3
'
' Operation 1: replace 'k' with 's'
' Operation 2: replace 'e' with 'i'
' Operation 3: insert 'g' at the end
' Example 2:
' Input: $S1 = "sunday"; $S2 = "monday"
' Output: 2
'
' Operation 1: replace 's' with 'm'
' Operation 2: replace 'u' with 'o'
