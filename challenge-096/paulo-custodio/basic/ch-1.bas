' TASK #1 â€º Reverse Words
' Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
' You are given a string $S.
' 
' Write a script to reverse the order of words in the given string. The string 
' may contain leading/trailing spaces. The string may have more than one space 
' between words in the string. Print the result without leading/trailing spaces 
' and there should be only one space between words.
' 
' Example 1:
' Input: $S = "The Weekly Challenge"
' Output: "Challenge Weekly The"

function join_args() as string
	dim text as string
	dim i as integer
	
	i = 1
	do while command(i)<>""
		text &= trim(command(i))+" "
		i += 1
	loop
	join_args = trim(text)
end function

sub split_text(words() as string, text as string)
	dim p as integer
	
	redim preserve words(0)
	text = trim(text)
	p = instr(text, " ")
	do while p > 0
		redim preserve words(ubound(words)+1)
		words(ubound(words)) = left(text, p-1)
		text = trim(mid(text, p+1))
		p = instr(text, " ")
	loop
	'store last segment
	redim preserve words(ubound(words)+1)
	words(ubound(words)) = text
end sub

sub print_reverse(words() as string) 
	dim i as integer
	
	for i = ubound(words) to 1 step -1
		print words(i);" ";
	next i
	print
