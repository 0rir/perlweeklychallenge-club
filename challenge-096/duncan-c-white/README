Task 1: "Palindrome Number

You are given a number $N.
Write a script to figure out if the given number is Palindrome.
Print 1 if true otherwise 0.

Example 1:

	Input: 1221
	Output: 1

Example 2:

	Input: -101
	Output: 0, since -101 and 101- are not the same.

Example 3:

	Input: 90
	Output: 0
"

My notes: sounds trivial.  N == join(reverse(split(N)))


Task 2: "Demo Stack

Write a script to demonstrate Stack operations like below:

push($n) - add $n to the stack
pop() - remove the top element
top() - get the top element
min() - return the minimum element

Example:

my $stack = Stack->new;
$stack->push(2);
$stack->push(-1);
$stack->push(0);
$stack->pop;       # removes 0
print $stack->top; # prints -1
$stack->push(0);
print $stack->min; # prints -1
"

My notes: ok so by "script" we mean "Perl class".  Very easy to do,
but I wonder what ch-2.pl does - contains the above example I guess.
On second thought, let's inline the Stack module into ch-2.pl..
