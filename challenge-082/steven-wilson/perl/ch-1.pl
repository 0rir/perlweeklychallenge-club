=head1 TASK #1 â€º Common Factors
Submitted by: Niels van Dijke

You are given 2 positive numbers $M and $N.

Write a script to list all common factors of the given numbers.
Example 1:

Input:
    $M = 12
    $N = 18

Output:
    (1, 2, 3, 6)

Explanation:
    Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
    Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9

Example 2:

Input:
    $M = 18
    $N = 23

Output:
    (1)

Explanation:
    Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
    Factors of 23: 1
