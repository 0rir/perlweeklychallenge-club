# TASK #1 â€º Common Factors
# Submitted by: Niels van Dijke
# You are given 2 positive numbers $M and $N.

# Write a script to list all common factors of the given numbers.

# Example 1:
# Input:
#     $M = 12
#     $N = 18

# Output:
#     (1, 2, 3, 6)

# Explanation:
#     Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
#     Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
# Example 2:
# Input:
#     $M = 18
#     $N = 23

# Output:
#     (1)

# Explanation:
#     Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
#     Factors of 23: 1
