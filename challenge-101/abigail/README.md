## [Pack a Spiral](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-101/#TASK1)

You are given an array `@A` of items (integers say, but they can be anything).

Your task is to pack that array into an `MxN` matrix spirally
counterclockwise, as tightly as possible.

'Tightly' means the absolute value `|M-N|` of the difference has to be as
small as possible

### Examples
#### Example 1
~~~~
Input: @A = (1,2,3,4)

Output:

    4 3
    1 2
~~~~

Since the given array is already a `1x4` matrix on its own, but that's
not as tight as possible. Instead, you'd spiral it counterclockwise into

~~~~
    4 3
    1 2
~~~~
#### Example 2
~~~~
Input: @A = (1..6)

Output:

    6 5 4
    1 2 3
~~~~
or
~~~~
    5 4
    6 3
    1 2
~~~~
Either will do as an answer, because they're equally tight.

#### Example 3
~~~~
Input: @A = (1..12)

Output:
       9  8  7 6
      10 11 12 5
       1  2  3 4
~~~~
or
~~~~
       8  7 6
       9 12 5
      10 11 4
       1  2 3
~~~~

## [Origin-containing Triangle](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-101/#TASK2)

You are given three points in the plane, as a list of six co-ordinates:
`A=(x1,y1)`, `B=(x2,y2)` and `C=(x3,y3)`.

Write a script to find out if the triangle formed by the given three
co-ordinates contain origin `(0,0)`.

Print `1` if found otherwise `0`.

### Examples
#### Example 1
~~~~
Input: A=(0,1), B=(1,0) and C=(2,2)

Output: 0 because that triangle does not contain (0,0).
~~~~

#### Example 2
~~~~
Input: A=(1,1), B=(-1,1) and C=(0,-3)

Output: 1 because that triangle contains (0,0) in its interior.
~~~~

#### Example 3
~~~~
Input: A=(0,1), B=(2,0) and C=(-6,0)

Output: 1 because (0,0) is on the edge connecting B and C.
