# Given two input words and a file that contains an ordered word list, implement a 
# routine (e.g., find_shortest_ladder(word1, word2, wordlist)) that finds the shortest 
# ladder between the two input words. 
#
# A word ladder is a sequence of words [w_0, w_1, ..., w_n] such that each word w_i in 
# the sequence is obtained by changing a single character in the word wi-1.
