# Challenge 207 - 2 - H index

# The H-Index is the largest number h such that h articles have at least h citations each. 
# For example, if an author has five publications, with 9, 7, 6, 2, and 1 citations (ordered from greatest to least), then the authorâ€™s h-index is 3, because the author has three publications with 3 or more citations. 
# However, the author does not have four publications with 4 or more citations.


hIndex(9, 7, 6, 2);         #  3
hIndex(10, 8, 5, 4, 3);     #  4
hIndex(25, 8, 5, 3, 3);     #  3
hIndex(1, 1, 1, 1, 1);      #  1
hIndex(2, 2);               #  2
