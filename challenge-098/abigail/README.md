## [Read N-characters](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-098/#TASK1)

You are given file `$FILE`.

Create subroutine `readN($FILE, $number)` returns the first `n`-characters
and moves the pointer to the (`n+1`)th character.

### Notes

What a poorly defined challenge.

> You are given a file

What does that mean? Do we get the content? A file handle?
A file descriptor? A file name?

The example (but not the challenge itself), suggest we're getting
a file name. Ok, but....:

> moves the pointer

What pointer? File handles/descriptors point to something, so
then it can be argued we should leave the file handle open, 
pointing to a place in the file. But we have just established we
are *not getting* a file handle -- we're getting a file name.
So, what pointer are we talking about?

What on earth are we supposed to do?

Are we supposed to create a file handle, and keep file handle open?
Should we just slurp in the file content, and keep a pointer
to what we have returned?

What should happen if we call `readN` with different files, interleaved?
Keep track of where we are for each file? Restart if called with `file1`,
then `file2`, and then `file1` again?

Our implementation will be a real stab in the dark -- we've no idea what
we are supposed to do.

### Input
Our program will read lines from standard input; each line consists
of a filename and an amount of characters to read, separated by whitespace.

### Example
~~~~
Input: Suppose the file (input.txt) contains "1234567890"
Output:
    print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "1234"
    print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "5678"
    print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "90"

## [Search Insert Position](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-098/#TASK2)

You are given a sorted array of distinct integers `@N` and a target `$N`.

Write a script to return the index of the given target if found
otherwise place the target in the sorted array and return the index.

### Examples
#### Example 1
~~~~
Input: @N = (1, 2, 3, 4) and $N = 3
Output: 2 since the target 3 is in the array at the index 2.
~~~~

#### Example 2
~~~~
Input: @N = (1, 3, 5, 7) and $N = 6
Output: 3 since the target 6 is missing and should be placed at the index 3.
~~~~

#### Example 3
~~~~
Input: @N = (12, 14, 16, 18) and $N = 10
Output: 0 since the target 10 is missing and should be placed at the index 0.
~~~~

#### Example 4
~~~~
Input: @N = (11, 13, 15, 17) and $N = 19
Output: 4 since the target 19 is missing and should be placed at the index 4.
