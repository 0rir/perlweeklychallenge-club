TASK #2 â€º Search Insert Position
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
You are given a sorted array of distinct integers @N and a target $N.

Write a script to return the index of the given target if found otherwise place the target in the sorted array and return the index.

    Example 1:
        Input: @N = (1, 2, 3, 4) and $N = 3
        Output: 2 since the target 3 is in the array at the index 2.
    Example 2:
        Input: @N = (1, 3, 5, 7) and $N = 6
        Output: 3 since the target 6 is missing and should be placed at the index 3.
    Example 3:
        Input: @N = (12, 14, 16, 18) and $N = 10
        Output: 0 since the target 10 is missing and should be placed at the index 0.
    Example 4:
        Input: @N = (11, 13, 15, 17) and $N = 19
        Output: 4 since the target 19 is missing and should be placed at the index 4.
