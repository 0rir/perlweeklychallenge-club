TASK #1 â€º Read N-characters
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
You are given file $FILE.

Create subroutine readN($FILE, $number) returns the first n-characters and moves the pointer to the (n+1)th character.

Example:
    Input: Suppose the file (input.txt) contains "1234567890"
    Output:
        print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "1234"
        print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "5678"
        print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "90"
