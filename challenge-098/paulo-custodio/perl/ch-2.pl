# TASK #2 â€º Search Insert Position
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given a sorted array of distinct integers @N and a target $N.
#
# Write a script to return the index of the given target if found
# otherwise place the target in the sorted array and return the index.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: @N = (1, 2, 3, 4) and $N = 3
# Output: 2 since the target 3 is in the array at the index 2.
# Example 2:
# Input: @N = (1, 3, 5, 7) and $N = 6
# Output: 3 since the target 6 is missing and should be placed at
# the index 3.
# Example 3:
# Input: @N = (12, 14, 16, 18) and $N = 10
# Output: 0 since the target 10 is missing and should be placed at
# the index 0.
# Example 4:
# Input: @N = (11, 13, 15, 17) and $N = 19
# Output: 4 since the target 19 is missing and should be placed at
# the index 4.
