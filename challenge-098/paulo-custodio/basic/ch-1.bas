' TASK #1 â€º Read N-characters
' Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
' You are given file $FILE.
'
' Create subroutine readN($FILE, $number) returns the first n-characters and
' moves the pointer to the (n+1)th character.
'
' Example:
' Input: Suppose the file (input.txt) contains "1234567890"
' Output:
'     print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "1234"
'     print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "5678"
'     print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "90"
