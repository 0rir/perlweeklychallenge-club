Challenge 1:

The simplest solution I could think of was conversion of a numeric (integer) string through 
the use of the built-in Int method:

  my $a = "004"       # Example string representing positive integer with leading zeros
  my $b = $a.Int      # Convert string to Int using built-in method Int, and so strip zeros
  say $b              # Print the Int; OUTPUT: 4

In a Perl6/Bash one-liner, this would look something like this:

  perl6 -pe '$_=.Int' <<< 004

but this, in itself, isn't very practical since Bash can do it with even less fuzz:

  a="004"
  echo ${a##+(0)}

Challenge 2:
------------
The obvious way to go is probably the use of Perl6' .base and .parse-base methods:

loop {

    my Str $a = prompt("\nPlease, give me a decimal (base-10) number : ");
    say("$a in decimal notation is { $a.Int.base(35) } in base-35 notation.");

    $a = prompt("\nNow give me a base-35 number [A-Y0-9]: ");
    say("$a in base-35 notation is { $a.parse-base(35) } in base-10 notation.")

}
