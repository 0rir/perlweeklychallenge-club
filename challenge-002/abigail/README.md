## [Challenge #1](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-002/#challenge-1)

Write a script or one-liner to remove leading zeros from positive numbers.

### Notes
We will be reading numbers from STDIN, and writing the results to STDOUT,
one number per line.

We cannot have a number with just 0's, as that would not be a positive number.

## [Challenge #2](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-002/#challenge-2)

Write a script that can convert integers to and from a base35
representation, using the characters 0-9 and A-Y. Dave Jacoby came
up with nice description about
[base35](https://gist.github.com/jacoby/764bb4e8a5d3a819b5fbfa497fcb3454),
in case you needed some background.

### Note
We will be reading numbers from STDIN, and writing the results to STDOUT,
one number per line. We'll use a prefix (T/F) to indicate whether the
number needs to be translated To of From base35.
