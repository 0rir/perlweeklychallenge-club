Task 1: "Array of Product

You are given an array of positive integers @N.

Write a script to return an array @M where $M[i] is the product of all elements of @N except the index $N[i].

Example 1:

Input:
    @N = (5, 2, 1, 4, 3)
Output:
    @M = (24, 60, 120, 30, 40)

    $M[0] = 2 x 1 x 4 x 3 = 24
    $M[1] = 5 x 1 x 4 x 3 = 60
    $M[2] = 5 x 2 x 4 x 3 = 120
    $M[3] = 5 x 2 x 1 x 3 = 30
    $M[4] = 5 x 2 x 1 x 4 = 40

Example 2:

Input:
    @N = (2, 1, 4, 3)
Output:
    @M = (12, 24, 6, 8)

    $M[0] = 1 x 4 x 3 = 12
    $M[1] = 2 x 4 x 3 = 24
    $M[2] = 2 x 1 x 3 = 6
    $M[3] = 2 x 1 x 4 = 8
"

My notes: clearly defined.  So M[i] is product(all elements)/M[i]
Hang on! unless M[i]==0 in which it's product(all other elements)


Task 2: "Spiral Matrix

You are given m x n matrix of positive integers.

Write a script to print a spiral path throught the matrix as list.

Example 1:

Input:
    [ 1, 2, 3 ]
    [ 4, 5, 6 ]
    [ 7, 8, 9 ]
Ouput:
    [ 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5 ]

Example 2:

Input:
    [  1,  2,  3,  4 ]
    [  5,  6,  7,  8 ]
    [  9, 10, 11, 12 ]
    [ 13, 14, 15, 16 ]
Output:
    [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10 ]
"

My notes: clearly defined.  Is "a spiral path" clear?  Think so.
