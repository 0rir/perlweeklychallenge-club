Task 1: Third Highest

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to find out the Third Highest if found otherwise return
the maximum.

Example 1

  Input: @array = (5,3,4)
  Output: 3

  First highest is 5.
  Second highest is 4.
  Third highest is 3.

Example 2

  Input: @array = (5,6)
  Output: 6

  First highest is 6.
  Second highest is 5.
  Third highest is missing, so maximum is returned.

Example 3

  Input: @array = (5,4,4,3)
  Output: 3

  First highest is 5. Second highest is 4. Third highest is 3.

MY NOTES: seems very easy.  sort, take 3rd biggest distinct element
(or biggest element if less than 3)

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for the translation)


Task 2: Maximum XOR

You are given an array of integers.
Write a script to find the highest value obtained by XORing any two
distinct members of the array.

Example 1

  Input: @array = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
  Output: 7

  The maximum result of 1 xor 6 = 7.

Example 2

  Input: @array = (2,4,1,3)
  Output: 7

  The maximum result of 4 xor 3 = 7.

Example 3

  Input: @array = (10,5,7,12,8)
  Output: 15

  The maximum result of 10 xor 5 = 15.

MY NOTES: also quite easy, try all combinations, pick max of all xors.

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-2.pl
into C (look in the C directory for the translation).  Needed to
pass original sizes into C routine..
