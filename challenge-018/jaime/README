# Challenge #1

Write a script that takes 2 or more strings as command line parameters and print the longest common substring. For example, the longest common substring of the strings “ABABC”, “BABCA” and “ABCBA” is string “ABC” of length 3. Other common substrings are “A”, “AB”, “B”, “BA”, “BC” and “C”. 

# Challenge #2

Write a script to implement Priority Queue. It is like regular queue except each element has a priority associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. Please check this wiki page for more informations. It should serve the following operations:

1. is_empty: check whether the queue has no elements.

2. insert_with_priority: add an element to the queue with an associated priority.

3. pull_highest_priority_element: remove the element from the queue that has the highest priority, and return it. If two elements have the same priority, then return element added first.
