# # Challenge #2
#
# Write a script to implement Priority Queue. It is like regular queue
# except each element has a priority associated with it. In a priority
# queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with
# low priority. It should serve the following operations:
#
# 1. is_empty: check whether the queue has no elements.
#
# 2. insert_with_priority: add an element to the queue with an
# associated priority.
#
# 3. pull_highest_priority_element: remove the element from the queue
# that has the highest priority, and return it. If two elements have the
# same priority, then return element added first.
