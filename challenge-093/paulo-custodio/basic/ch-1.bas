' TASK #1 â€º Max Points
' Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
' You are given set of co-ordinates @N.
'
' Write a script to count maximum points on a straight line when given co-ordinates plotted on 2-d plane.
'
' Example 1:
' |
' |     x
' |   x
' | x
' + _ _ _ _
'
' Input: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
' Output: 3
' Example 2:
' |
' |
' | x       x
' |   x
' | x   x
' + _ _ _ _ _
'
' Input: (1,1), (2,2), (3,1), (1,3), (5,3)
' Output: 3
