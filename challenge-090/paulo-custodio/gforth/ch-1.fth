\ TASK #1 › DNA Sequence
\ Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
\ DNA is a long, chainlike molecule which has two strands twisted into a double helix. 
\ The two strands are made up of simpler molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is 
\ composed of one of the four nitrogen-containing nucleobases cytosine (C), guanine (G), 
\ adenine (A) and thymine (T).
\ 
\ You are given DNA sequence, 
\ GTAAACCCCTTTTCATTTAGACAGATCGACTCCTTATCCATTCTCAGAGATGTGTTGCTGGTCGCCG.
\ 
\ Write a script to print nucleiobase count in the given DNA sequence. Also print the 
\ complementary sequence where Thymine (T) on one strand is always facing an adenine (A)
\ and vice versa; guanine (G) is always facing a cytosine (C) and vice versa.

\ start with sequence in input buffer
