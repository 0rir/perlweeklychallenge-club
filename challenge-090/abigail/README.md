# Task 1: DNA Sequence

DNA is a long, chainlike molecule which has two strands twisted
into a double helix. The two strands are made up of simpler molecules
called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of the four
nitrogen-containing nucleobases cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine
(A) and thymine (T).

You are given DNA sequence,
`GTAAACCCCTTTTCATTTAGACAGATCGACTCCTTATCCATTCTCAGAGATGTGTTGCTGGTCGCCG`.

Write a script to print nucleiobase count in the given DNA sequence.
Also print the complementary sequence where Thymine (`T`) on one
strand is always facing an adenine (`A`) and vice versa; guanine (`G`)
is always facing a cytosine (`C`) and vice versa.

To get the complementary sequence use the following mapping:

    T => A
    A => T
    G => C
    C => G
