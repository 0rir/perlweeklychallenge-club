TASK #1 - Pythagorean Means

You are given a set of integers.

Write a script to compute all three Pythagorean Means i.e Arithmetic Mean,
Geometric Mean and Harmonic Mean of the given set of integers. Please
refer to wikipedia page for more informations.

Example 1:

	Input: @n = (1,3,5,6,9)
	Output: AM = 4.8, GM = 3.9, HM = 2.8

Example 2:

	Input: @n = (2,4,6,8,10)
	Output: AM = 6.0, GM = 5.2, HM = 4.4

Example 3:

	Input: @n = (1,2,3,4,5)
	Output: AM = 3.0, GM = 2.6, HM = 2.2

MY NOTES: ok.  Pretty easy, although the geometric mean involves
calculating the product of the numbers, which may get pretty huge.
Tried bigrat, but it broke the nth-root calculation using **.


TASK #2 - Brazilian Number

You are given a number $n > 3.

Write a script to find out if the given number is a Brazilian Number.

A positive integer number N has at least one natural number B where
1 < B < N-1 where the representation of N in base B has same digits.


Example 1:

Input: $n = 7
Output: 1

Since 7 in base 2 is 111.

Example 2:

Input: $n = 6
Output: 0

Since 6 in base 2 is 110,
      6 in base 3 is 20 and
      6 in base 4 is 12.

Example 3:

Input: $n = 8
Output: 1

Since 8 in base 3 is 22.


MY NOTES: ok, so "same digits" really means "the same base-b digit
repeated throughout the entire string".  Sounds pretty easy.
Added debugging mode to produce and display the "Since" messages,
formatted nicely.  Then added tabulate mode to show the first N
Brazilian numbers (this interoperates nicely with -d).
