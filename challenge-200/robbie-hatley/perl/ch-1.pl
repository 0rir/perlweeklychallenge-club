Task 1: Arithmetic Slices
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
You are given an array of integers. Write a script to find out all Arithmetic
Slices for the given array of integers. An integer array is called "arithmetic"
if it has at least 3 elements and the differences between any three
consecutive elements are the same.

Example 1:  Input: @array = (1,2,3,4)  Output: (1,2,3), (2,3,4), (1,2,3,4)
Example 2:  Input: @array = (2)        Output: () as no slice found.

# NOTE: Input is by either built-in array of arrays, or by @ARGV. If using
#       @ARGV, input should be a space-separated list of integers, which will
#       be interpreted as a single array.

# NOTE: Output is to stdout and will be a list of all arithmetic slice for
#       each input array.

# PRELIMINARIES:
