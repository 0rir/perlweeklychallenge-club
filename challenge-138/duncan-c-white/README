TASK #1 - Long Year

Write a script to find all the years between 1900 and 2100 which is a Long Year.

    A year is Long if it has 53 weeks.

For more information about Long Year, please refer to

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Weeks_per_year

Expected Output

1903, 1908, 1914, 1920, 1925,
1931, 1936, 1942, 1948, 1953,
1959, 1964, 1970, 1976, 1981,
1987, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2009,
2015, 2020, 2026, 2032, 2037,
2043, 2048, 2054, 2060, 2065,
2071, 2076, 2082, 2088, 2093,
2099

MY NOTES: Pretty easy.  Especially using the p(year) and weeks(year) functions given,
won't even need a date manipulation module..


TASK #2 - Lychrel Number

You are given a number, 10 <= $n <= 1000.

Write a script to find out if the given number is Lychrel number;
output 1 if it is, and zero if it is not.  To keep the task simple, we impose the following rules:

a. Stop and return 1 if the number of iterations reached 500.
b. Stop and return 1 if you end up with number >= 10_000_000.

According to wikipedia:

    A Lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome
    through the iterative process of repeatedly reversing its digits
    and adding the resulting numbers.

Example 1

	Input: $n = 56
	Output: 0

	After 1 iteration, we found palindrome number.
	56 + 65 = 121

Example 2

	Input: $n = 57
	Output: 0

	After 2 iterations, we found palindrome number.
	 57 +  75 = 132
	132 + 231 = 363

Example 3

	Input: $n = 59
	Output: 0

	After 3 iterations, we found palindrome number.
	 59 +  95 =  154
	154 + 451 =  605
	605 + 506 = 1111

MY NOTES: Sounds pretty easy.  The strangest thing about this question
is that the Wikipedia page has that (without the artificial constraints)
noone found a definite Lychrel base 10 number.  So any "Output: 1" entries
we can find (such as 89) are caused by sequences violating one or other
of the constraints.
