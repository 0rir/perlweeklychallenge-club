TASK #1 - Workdays

You are given a year, $year in 4-digits form.

Write a script to calculate the total number of workdays in the given year.
For the task, we consider, Monday - Friday as workdays.

Example 1

	Input: $year = 2021
	Output: 261

Example 2

	Input: $year = 2020
	Output: 262

MY NOTES: Pretty easy.  Essentially: iterate over all days in $year, inc
count if day_of_week(that day) is a week day (Mon..Fri).  Date::Simple
looks like it can do everything we need.


TASK #2 - Split Number

You are given a perfect square.

Write a script to figure out if the square root the given number is same
as sum of 2 or more splits of the given number.

Example 1

	Input: $n = 81
	Output: 1

	Since, sqrt(81) = 8 + 1

Example 2

	Input: $n = 9801
	Output: 1

	Since, sqrt(9801) = 98 + 0 + 1

Example 3

	Input: $n = 36
	Output: 0

	Since, sqrt(36) != 3 + 6

MY NOTES: Sounds pretty easy.  The only tricky part is identifying all
distinct "splits" of the number.  Is there a "binary counting" method,
where bit i being true means: split the number between digit i and i+1?

BONUS: I was interested in how many perfect squares do have this "split
summing to the sqrt" property, so I added tabulate-split-sums which
tries the first N perfect squares, and prints out those that do have
this property. 81 is the first, 100 the second, 1296 the third etc..
