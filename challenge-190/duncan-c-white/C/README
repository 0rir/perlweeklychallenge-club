Thought I'd also have a go at translating ch-1.pl and ch-2.pl into C..

Both produce near-identical (non-debugging) output to my Perl originals.

They use several of my regular support modules:
- a command-line argument processing module args.[ch],
- a csvlist-of-int parsing module parseints.[ch], and
- an int-array printing module printarray.[ch].
