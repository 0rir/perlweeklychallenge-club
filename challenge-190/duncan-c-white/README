Task 1: Capital Detection

You are given a string with alphabetic characters only: A..Z and a..z.

Write a script to find out if the usage of Capital is appropriate if it
satisfies any of the following rules:

1) Only first letter is capital and all others are small.
2) Every letter is small.
3) Every letter is capital.

Example 1
	Input: $s = 'Perl'
	Output: 1

Example 2
	Input: $s = 'TPF'
	Output: 1

Example 3
	Input: $s = 'PyThon'
	Output: 0

Example 4
	Input: $s = 'raku'
	Output: 1

MY NOTES: very easy.

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for the translation)


Task 2: Decoded List

You are given an encoded string $s consisting of a sequence of numeric
characters: 0..9.

Write a script to find all valid different decodings in sorted order.

Encoding is simply done by mapping A,B,C,D,# to 1,2,3,4,# etc.

Example 1
	Input: $s = 11
	Output: AA, K

	11 can be decoded as (1 1) or (11) i.e. AA or K

Example 2
	Input: $s = 1115
	Output: AAAE, AAO, AKE, KAE, KO

	Possible decoded data are:
	(1 1 1 5) => (AAAE)
	(1 1 15)  => (AAO)
	(1 11 5)  => (AKE)
	(11 1 5)  => (KAE)
	(11 15)   => (KO)

Example 3
	Input: $s = 127
	Output: ABG, LG

	Possible decoded data are:
	(1 2 7) => (ABG)
	(12 7)  => (LG)

MY NOTES: Hmm.. may be simple "take 1 or 2 chars off the front" (if that
front part is in 1..26 range), plus recursive processing of what's left, with a prefix
added to each sub-solution..
