TASK #1 - Add Binary

You are given two decimal-coded binary numbers, $a and $b.

Write a script to simulate the addition of the given binary numbers.

Example 1

	Input: $a = 11; $b = 1;
	Output: 100

Example 2

	Input: $a = 101; $b = 1;
	Output: 110

Example 3

	Input: $a = 100; $b = 11;
	Output: 111

MY NOTES: Very easy.  Extract least significant binary digit via $a % 10,
implement full adder (bit,bit,carryin)->(bit,carryout), recurse and recombine.


TASK #2 - Multiplication Table

You are given 3 positive integers, $i, $j and $k.

Write a script to print the $kth element in the sorted multiplication
table of $i and $j.

Example 1

	Input: $i = 2; $j = 3; $k = 4
	Output: 3

Since the multiplication of 2 x 3 is as below:

    1 2 3
    2 4 6

The sorted multiplication table:

    1 2 2 3 4 6

Now the 4th element in the table is "3".

Example 2

	Input: $i = 3; $j = 3; $k = 6
	Output: 4

Since the multiplication of 3 x 3 is as below:

    1 2 3
    2 4 6
    3 6 9

The sorted multiplication table:

    1 2 2 3 3 4 6 6 9

Now the 6th element in the table is "4".


MY NOTES: Sounds pretty easy.  The table's ith row is (1..$j) * $i.
