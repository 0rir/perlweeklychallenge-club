    TASK #1 â€º Add Binary
    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given two decimal-coded binary numbers, $a and $b.

    Write a script to simulate the addition of the given binary numbers.

    The script should simulate something like $a + $b. (operator overloading)

        Example 1
            Input: $a = 11; $b = 1;
            Output: 100
        Example 2
            Input: $a = 101; $b = 1;
            Output: 110
        Example 3
            Input: $a = 100; $b = 11;
            Output: 111
"""


a = '11'
b = '1'

# binary to decimal, add, decimal to binary
add = bin(int(a,2) + int(b,2)).replace("0b", "")
print(add)
