Solutions to weekly challenge 71 by Bob Lied.

This week I would like to incorporate Test::More TDD into the problem, creating
some tests before even starting to program the answer.

* TASK #1 > Peak Element

** Initial thoughts

The first interesting problem is creating an array of unique random elements.
There is probably a CPAN module, but this is a programming challenge, so let's
program it.

Finding the peak looks like it will mean linear search, comparing the value
before and the value after.  Watch out for boundaries.  Maybe an easy trick
is to put 0 on the front of the list and 51 on the end.

** Problem Statement

You are given positive integer $N (>1).

Write a script to create an array of size $N with random unique elements between 1 and 50.

In the end it should print peak elements in the array, if found.

    An array element is called peak if it is bigger than itâ€™s neighbour.

Example 1
  Array: [ 18, 45, 38, 25, 10, 7, 21, 6, 28, 48 ]
  Peak: [ 48, 45, 21 ]

Example 2
  Array: [ 47, 11, 32, 8, 1, 9, 39, 14, 36, 23 ]
  Peak: [ 47, 32, 39, 36 ]
