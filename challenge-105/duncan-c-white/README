Task 1: "Nth root

You are given positive numbers $N and $k.

Write a script to find out the $Nth root of $k. For more information,
please take a look at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root#Computing_principal_roots

Example

	Input: $N = 5, $k = 248832
	Output: 12

	Input: $N = 5, $k = 34

"

My notes: ok, dull but easy, using the Newton-Raphson Method.


Task 2: "The Name Game

You are given a $name.

Write a script to display the lyrics to the Shirley Ellis song The Name
Game. Please checkout https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_Game
for more information.

Example

  Input: $name = "Katie"
  Output:

    Katie, Katie, bo-batie,
    Bonana-fanna fo-fatie
    Fee fi mo-matie
    Katie!
"

My notes: wtf?  are we reduced to ill-defined childhood rhymes now?
use simple rules:
- remove first consonant from name if the first letter is a consonant,
- otherwise leave the name alone.
- if the removed consonant was b, f or m, then (respectively) bo-b
  becomes bo-, fo-f becomes fo-, and mo-m becomes mo-
- ignore the "no indication what to do with names like Anita where the stress
  falls on a later syllable" problem, as that was in one cover version, so
  I claim it's not part of the official rules.
