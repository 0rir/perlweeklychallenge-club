## [Challenge 2](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-004/#challenge-2)

You are given a file containing a list of words (case insensitive
1 word per line) and a list of letters. Print each word from the
file that can be made using only letters from the list. You can use
each letter only once (though there can be duplicates and you can
use each of them once), you don't have to use all the letters.
