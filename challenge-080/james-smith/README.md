# Challenge 1 - Smallest Positive Number

After testing two solutions (using sort and using hash keys) it became obvious the best way of handling this is to sort the +ve numbers and them loop through them to find the first missing one (the first number which has the value in the array not equal to the 1-based index)

# Challenge 2 - Count candies

This is a simple sweep approach applying the b) rule multiple times until the counting stops!
