Task 1: Permuted Multiples

Write a script to find the smallest positive integer x such that x, 2x,
3x, 4x, 5x and 6x are permuted multiples of each other.

For example, the integers 125874 and 251748 are permutated multiples of
each other as

251784 = 2 x 125874

and also both have the same digits but in different order.

Output

  142857

MY NOTES: ok, sounds pretty easy.  Compare permutation either by forming
bags of digits and comparing them, or simply by sorting the digits
numerically (a signature) and comparing signatures.

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for that).


Task 2: Reversible Numbers

Write a script to find out all Reversible Numbers below 100.

A number is said to be a reversible if sum of the number and its reverse
had only odd digits.

For example,

36 is reversible number as 36 + 63 = 99 i.e. all digits are odd.
17 is not reversible as 17 + 71 = 88, none of the digits are odd.

Output

10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 27,
30, 32, 34, 36, 41, 43, 45, 50, 52,
54, 61, 63, 70, 72, 81, 90

MY NOTES: Unusually, this seems even easier than task 1.

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-2.pl
into C (look in the C directory for that).
