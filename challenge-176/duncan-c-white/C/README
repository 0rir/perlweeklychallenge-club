Thought I'd also have a go at translating ch-1.pl and ch-2.c into C..

Both ch-1.c and ch-2.c produce identical (non-debugging) output to my
Perl originals.

Both use the command-line argument processing module args.[ch].

Both very straightforward to do - although ch-1.c does manage to use
qsort() which is always a joy to get the comparator function right:-)
