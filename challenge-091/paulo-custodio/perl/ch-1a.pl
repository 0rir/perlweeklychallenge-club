# THE WEEKLY CHALLENGE - 091
# TASK #1: Count Number
#
# You are given a positive number $N. Write a script to count number and 
# display as you read it.

# Numeric recursive solution:
# A solution without regular expressions, where the last digit is extracted 
# by the reminder of the division by 10, and the value divided by 10. This
# process is repeated while the last digit is the same, counting the number 
# of repetitions. The function then recurses to display the count of the
# previous digits, and then displays its own count.

	my($n) = @_;
	read_number_($n);
	print "\n";
}

sub read_number_ {
	my($n) = @_;
	return unless $n > 0;	# end condition
	
	# count number of equal digits at the end
	my $digit = $n % 10;
	my $count = 0;
	while ($n > 0 && ($n % 10) == $digit) {
		$n = int($n / 10);
		$count++;
	}

	# recurse to print top part
