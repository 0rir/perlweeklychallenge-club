This is the beginning of the semester of my PG dip in IT; and I have finished all exams and assignments from the previous semester. Somehow today I want to try to play with programming languages. While Mohammad has said, having fun is important in learning, now I try to do the Task 1 in different programming languages which I am fluent at least at the "sightseeing purpose", within 4 days.

Target list:
awk bash C++
Java Node.js Julia
LISP PHP Perl Smalltalk
Befunge-93 (if I have that mentality)

Script done (last update: Fri Jan 14 03:25:06 2022): 
1. Julia
2. Perl
3. Smalltalk
4. Java
