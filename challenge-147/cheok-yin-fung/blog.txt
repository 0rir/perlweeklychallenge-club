This is the beginning of the semester of my PG dip in IT; and I have finished all exams and assignments from the previous semester. Somehow today I want to try to play with programming languages. While Mohammad has said, having fun is important in learning, now I try to do the Task 1 in different programming languages which I am fluent at least at the "sightseeing purpose", within 4 days.

Target list was:
awk bash
C++
Java Node.js Julia
LISP PHP Perl Smalltalk
Befunge-93 (if I have that mentality)

Scripts done (last update: Saturday, January 15, 2022 AM08:27:00 HKT): 
1. Julia
2. Perl
3. Smalltalk
4. Java
5. C++
6. Node.js
7. Awk (slow)
8. Bash (slow)
9. 

Left:
LISP
