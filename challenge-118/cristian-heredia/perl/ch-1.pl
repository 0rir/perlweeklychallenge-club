    TASK #1 â€º Binary Palindrome
    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given a positive integer $N.

    Write a script to find out if the binary representation of the given integer is Palindrome. Print 1 if it is otherwise 0.

        Example
            Input: $N = 5
            Output: 1 as binary representation of 5 is 101 which is Palindrome.

            Input: $N = 4
            Output: 0 as binary representation of 4 is 100 which is NOT Palindrome.
