# TASK #1 › Pattern Match
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given a string $S and a pattern $P.
#
# Write a script to check if given pattern validate the entire string.
# Print 1 if pass otherwise 0.
#
# The patterns can also have the following characters:
#
# ? - Match any single character.
# * - Match any sequence of characters.
# Example 1:
# Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "a*e"
# Output: 1
# Example 2:
# Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "a*d"
# Output: 0
# Example 3:
# Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "?b*d"
# Output: 0
# Example 4:
# Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "a*c?e"
# Output: 1

    s/\\\*/.*/g;        # replace * (now \*) by .*
    s/\\\?/./g;         # replace ? (now \?) by .
}

# and match it
say $S =~ /^$rx$/ ? 1 : 0;
