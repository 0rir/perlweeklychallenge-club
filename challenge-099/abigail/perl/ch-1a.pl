# Use a recursive method to see whether a pattern matches a string:
# ("PPP" is any pattern, possible empty; the string is of the form
#  "sSSS" (if non-empty), where "s" is any single character, and "SSS"
#  a possible empty substring).
#
#    - If both the string and pattern are empty, the match succeeds.
#    - If the string is empty:
#         o If the pattern is of the form "*PPP", the result is the
#           match of the string against "PPP"
#         o Else, the match fails.
#    - If pattern is the form "*PPP":
#         o if the pattern is "*", the match succeeds.
#         o if the pattern is of the form "**PPP", the result is the match
#           of the  string against "*PPP".
#         o if "SSS" (that is, the string without its leading character)
#           is matches by the pattern, the match succeeds
#         o if the pattern is of the form "*sPPP", or "*?PPP" (that is,
#           the character after the leading * is a ? or the first character
#           of the string), the results of the match is the match of
#           "SSS" against "PPP".
#         o else, the match fails.
#    - If the string is of the form "sSSS", and the pattern is of the
#      form "sPPP" or "?PPP", the result of the match is the match of
#      "SSS" against "PPP".
#    - Else, the match fails.
