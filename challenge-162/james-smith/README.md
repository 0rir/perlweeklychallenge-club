# The Weekly Challenge 162

You can find more information about this weeks, and previous weeks challenges at:

  https://theweeklychallenge.org/

If you are not already doing the challenge - it is a good place to practise your
**perl** or **raku**. If it is not **perl** or **raku** you develop in - you can
submit solutions in whichever language you feel comfortable with.

You can find the solutions here on github at:

# Challenge 1 - Validate ISBN-13

***Write a script to generate the check digit of given ISBN-13 code. Checksum is generated by summing the numbers in the odd positions with 3 times the sum of the numbers in the even positions. The checksum digit is the number you would add to get a total of 0***

## The solution

Rather than computing the checksum - as we have ISBN numbers with the checksum we will validate the numbers {checking the checksum calculated is equal to the last digit in the ISNB number].

```perl
sub validate_isbn13 {
  my( $s, @p ) = ( 0, grep {/\d/} split //, $_[0] );
  $s -= shift(@p) + 3*shift @p for 0..5;
  $p[0] == $s%10;
}
```

# Challenge 2 - Wheatstone-Playfair

***Implement encryption and decryption using the Wheatstone-Playfair cipher.***

I'm not going to try and explain this here - but refer you to wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher

First we note the only difference between encryption and decryption is the direction we move left->right up->down of *vv*, so we can implement these with a single "function" and two wrappers "emcrypt" and "decrypt". Often two way ciphers have this feature.

We first create a hash and array which map the letter to their position and their position to the letter. This makes the future calculations easier
```perl
sub encrypt { return _crypt( 1,@_); }
sub decrypt { return _crypt(-1,@_); }

sub _crypt {
  my($off,$key,$p,$out,@r,%l) = (shift,shift,0,'');           ## Initialise variables and get mapping...
  ($_ eq 'j' && ($_='i')), exists $l{$_} || ($l{$_}=[int $p/5,($p++)%5]) for grep { /[a-z]/ } split(//,$key),'a'..'i','j'..'z';
  $r[$l{$_}[0]][$l{$_}[1]]=$_ for keys %l;

  my @seq = grep {/[a-z]/} split //, shift =~ s{j}{j}gr;      ## Prep sequence

  while(my($m,$n)=splice @seq,0,2) {                          ## Loop through letter pairs
    unshift(@seq,$n), $n='x' if $n && $n eq $m and $n ne 'x'; ## Deal with case when both letters the same
    $n ||= 'x';                                               ## Pad if required...
    $out.= $l{$m}[0] eq $l{$n}[0] ? $r[ $l{$m}[0]        ][($l{$m}[1]+$off)%5] . $r[ $l{$n}[0]        ][($l{$n}[1]+$off)%5]
         : $l{$m}[1] eq $l{$n}[1] ? $r[($l{$m}[0]+$off)%5][ $l{$m}[1]        ] . $r[($l{$n}[0]+$off)%5][ $l{$n}[1]        ]
         :                          $r[ $l{$m}[0]        ][ $l{$n}[1]        ] . $r[ $l{$n}[0]        ][ $l{$m}[1]        ]
         ;
  }
  $out;
}
```
