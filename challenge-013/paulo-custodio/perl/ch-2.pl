# Challenge #2
# Write a script to demonstrate Mutually Recursive methods. Two methods are
# mutually recursive if the first method calls the second and the second calls
# first in turn. Using the mutually recursive methods, generate Hofstadter
# Female and Male sequences.

#  F ( 0 ) = 1   ;   M ( 0 ) = 0
#  F ( n ) = n − M ( F ( n − 1 ) ) , n > 0
#  M ( n ) = n − F ( M ( n − 1 ) ) , n > 0.
