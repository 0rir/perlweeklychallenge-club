Task 1: "Consecutive Arrays

You are given a sorted list of unique positive integers.

Write a script to return list of arrays where the arrays are consecutive
integers.

Example 1:

   Input:  (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9)
   Output: ([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 8, 9])

Example 2:

   Input:  (11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19)
   Output: ([11, 12], [14], [17, 18, 19])

Example 3:

   Input:  (2, 4, 6, 8)
   Output: ([2], [4], [6], [8])

Example 4:

   Input:  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
   Output: ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
"

My notes: easy, should be able to do this in 1-pass.


Task 2: "Find Pairs

You are given a string of delimiter pairs and a string to search.

Write a script to return two strings, the first with any characters
matching the 'opening character' set, the second with any matching
the 'closing character' set.

Example 1:

Input:
    Delimiter pairs: ""[]()
    Search String: "I like (parens) and the Apple ][+" they said.

Output:
    "(["
    ")]"

Example 2:

Input:
    Delimiter pairs: **//<>
    Search String: /* This is a comment (in some languages) */ <could be a tag>

Output:
    /**/<
    /**/>
"

My notes: also pretty easy, if I've understood it right.  Also doable in 1-pass.
