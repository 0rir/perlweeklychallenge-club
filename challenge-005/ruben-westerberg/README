Solution by Ruben Westerberg

#Challenge 1: Write a program which prints out all anagrams for a given word.

#Challenge 2: Write a program to find the sequence of characters that has the most anagrams

All solutions use an optional command line argument to specify a dictionary (one word per line) to check against.

By default the words list/dictionary used is words_aplha.txt, which was sourced from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
