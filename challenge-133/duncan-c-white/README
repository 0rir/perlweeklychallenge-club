TASK #1 - Integer Square Root

You are given a positive integer $N.

Write a script to calculate the integer square root of the given number.

Please avoid using a built-in function. Find out more about it:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_square_root

Examples

  Input: $N = 10
  Output: 3

  Input: $N = 27
  Output: 5

  Input: $N = 85
  Output: 9

  Input: $N = 101
  Output: 10

MY NOTES: Pretty easy as the Wikipedia page shows a C implementation


TASK #2 - Smith Numbers

Write a script to generate first 10 Smith Numbers in base 10.

According to Wikipedia:

"In number theory, a Smith number is a composite number for which, in
a given number base, the sum of its digits is equal to the sum of the
digits in its prime factorization in the given number base."

MY NOTES: Ok, an example in the Wikipedia clarifies this:

    4937775 = 3**1 5**2 658371 (prime factors)
    4 + 9 + 3 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 42
    3 x· 1 + 5x 2 + (6 + 5 + 8 + 3 + 7) x 1 = 42 too

Should be quite straightforward.
