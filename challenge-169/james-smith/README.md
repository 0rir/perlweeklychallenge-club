# Challenge 1 - Brilliant numbers 

***Write a script to generate first 20 Brilliant Numbers.  Brilliant numbers are numbers with two prime factors of the same length.  The number should have exactly two prime factors, i.e. itâ€™s the product of two primes of the same length.***


## Solution

Again our favourite package has the method we need `factor` which returns a list of prime factors.

All we need to do is check to see if there are 2 prime factors, and that the length of these are the same.

For flexibility we define the max count `$MAX` as the command-line argument if one is supplied (or 100 if not).

```perl
for( my( $n, $c, $MAX, @f ) = ( 0, 0, @ARGV ? $ARGV[0] : 1e2 ); $c<$MAX; $n++ ) {
  say sprintf '%7d: %10d = %10d x %10d', ++$c, $n, @f
    if 2 == ( @f=factor($n) ) && length( $f[0] ) == length $f[1];
}
```
The output is the brilliant number and the two primes which are it's factors.

# Challenge 2 - Achilles Number

***Write a script to generate first 20 Achilles Numbers. An Achilles number is a number that is powerful but imperfect (not a perfect power). Named after Achilles, a hero of the Trojan war, who was also powerful but imperfect.  A positive integer n is a powerful number if, for every prime factor p of n, p^2 is also a divisor, AND that the GCD of the powers is 1.  A number is a perfect power if it has any integer roots (square root, cube root, etc.).

## Solution

Our favourite prime library has the two methods we need `gcd` and `factor`. This simplfies the problem... foreach value we generate a hash of the primes, the key being the prime and the value the power.

We then check to see if any of the factors does not have its square as a factor. We do this in the grep - by using `next` we jump out of the `grep` back to the next entry in the `for` loop. We then compute the `gcd` of these powers if it is 1 then we display the result. We display the value, plus the primes and the powers...

```perl
for( my( $n, $c, $MAX ) = ( 2, 0, @ARGV ? $ARGV[0] : 1e2 ); $c<$MAX; $n++ ) {
  my %factors;
  $factors{$_}++ for factor $n;
  say sprintf '%6d: %15d = %s', ++$c, $n,
      join ' . ',
      map  { "$_^$factors{$_}" }
      sort { $a <=> $b }
      keys  %factors
    if 1 == gcd( grep { $_ < 2 ? next : 1 } values %factors )
}
```

**Note:** We use a classic "c-style" `for`-loop for the structure to capture the initialization, check and increment.
 
The following are the first 50 achilles numbers.
