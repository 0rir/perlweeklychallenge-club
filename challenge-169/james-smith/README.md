# The Weekly Challenge 169

You can find more information about this weeks, and previous weeks challenges at:

  https://theweeklychallenge.org/

If you are not already doing the challenge - it is a good place to practise your
**perl** or **raku**. If it is not **perl** or **raku** you develop in - you can
submit solutions in whichever language you feel comfortable with.

You can find the solutions here on github at:

# Challenge 1 - Brilliant numbers 

***Write a script to generate first 20 Brilliant Numbers.  Brilliant numbers are numbers with two prime factors of the same length.  The number should have exactly two prime factors, i.e. itâ€™s the product of two primes of the same length.***


## Solution

```perl
for( my( $n, $c, $MAX, @f ) = ( 0, 0, @ARGV ? $ARGV[0] : 1e2 ); $c<$MAX; $n++ ) {
  say sprintf '%10d: %30d %10d %10d', ++$c, $n, @f
    if 2 == ( @f=factor($n) ) && length( $f[0] ) == length $f[1];
}
```

# Challenge 2 - Achilles Number

***Write a script to generate first 20 Achilles Numbers. An Achilles number is a number that is powerful but imperfect (not a perfect power). Named after Achilles, a hero of the Trojan war, who was also powerful but imperfect.  A positive integer n is a powerful number if, for every prime factor p of n, p^2 is also a divisor.  A number is a perfect power if it has any integer roots (square root, cube root, etc.).

## Solution

Our favourite prime libray also has a `factor` function which returns a list of sorted prime factors (including duplicates). This simplfies the problem...

```perl
for( my( $n, $c, $MAX ) = ( 2, 0, @ARGV ? $ARGV[0] : 1e2 ); $c<$MAX; $n++ ) {
  my %factors;
  $factors{$_}++ foreach factor $n;
  say sprintf '%6d: %15d - %s', ++$c, $n,
      join ' . ',
      map  { "$_^$factors{$_}" }
      sort { $a <=> $b }
      keys  %factors
    if 1 == gcd( grep { $_ < 2 ? next : 1 } values %factors )
}
```
