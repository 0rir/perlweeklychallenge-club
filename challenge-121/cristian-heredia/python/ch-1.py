    TASK #1 â€º Invert Bit
    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given integers 0 <= $m <= 255 and 1 <= $n <= 8.

    Write a script to invert $n bit from the end of the binary representation of $m and print the decimal representation of the new binary number.

    Example
    Input: $m = 12, $n = 3
    Output: 8

    Binary representation of $m = 00001100
    Invert 3rd bit from the end = 00001000
    Decimal equivalent of 00001000 = 8

    Input $m = 18, $n = 4
    Output: 26

    Binary representation of $m = 00010010
    Invert 4th bit from the end = 00011010
    Decimal equivalent of 00011010 = 26
'''

m = 12
n = 3

# Convert to binary with leading 0
bits = list("{0:08b}".format(m))

# invert $n bit from the end of the binary
if bits[-n] == '0':
    bits[-n] = '1'
else:
    bits[-n] = '0'
    
# Convert to decimal string
result = int(''.join(bits), 2)
print(f"Output: {result}")
