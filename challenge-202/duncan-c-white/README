Task 1: Missing Numbers

You are given an array of unique numbers.  Write a script to find out
all missing numbers in the range 0..$n where $n is the array size.

Example 1

  Input: @array = (0,1,3)
  Output: 2

  The array size i.e. total element count is 3, so the range is 0..3.
  The missing number is 2 in the given array.

Example 2

  Input: @array = (0,1)
  Output: 2

  The array size is 2, therefore the range is 0..2.
  The missing number is 2.

MY NOTES: pretty easy.

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for the translation)


Task 2: Penny Piles

You are given an integer, $n > 0.

Write a script to determine the number of ways of putting $n pennies in a row of piles of ascending heights from left to right.
Example

Input: $n = 5
Output: 7

Since $n=5, there are 7 ways of stacking 5 pennies in ascending piles:

    1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 2
    1 1 3
    2 3
    1 4
    5

MY NOTES: not quite so easy, but doable.  Sounds recursive to me.
Let's produce the array of answers too..

into C (look in the C directory for the translation)
