Task 1: Consecutive Odds

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to print 1 if there are THREE consecutive odds in the
given array otherwise print 0.

Example 1

Input: @array = (1,5,3,6)
Output: 1

Example 2

Input: @array = (2,6,3,5)
Output: 0

Example 3

Input: @array = (1,2,3,4)
Output: 0

Example 4

Input: @array = (2,3,5,7)
Output: 1

MY NOTES: very easy.

GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
into C (look in the C directory for the translation)


Task 2: Widest Valley

Given a profile as a list of altitudes, return the leftmost widest
valley. A valley is defined as a subarray of the profile consisting
of two parts: the first part is non-increasing and the second part is
non-decreasing. Either part can be empty.

Example 1

Input: 1, 5, 5, 2, 8
Output: 5, 5, 2, 8

Example 2

Input: 2, 6, 8, 5
Output: 2, 6, 8

Example 3

Input: 9, 8, 13, 13, 2, 2, 15, 17
Output: 13, 13, 2, 2, 15, 17

Example 4

Input: 2, 1, 2, 1, 3
Output: 2, 1, 2

Example 5

Input: 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2
Output: 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3

MY NOTES: also quite easy, once we remove the negative "non-increasing"
language and realise we mean "find the leftmost longest sequence of one
or more adjacent numbers where initially the numbers go down (or stay
the same) and then they go up (or stay the same)."
