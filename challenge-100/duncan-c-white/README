Task 1: "Fun Time

You are given a time (12 hour / 24 hour).

Write a script to convert the given time from 12 hour format to 24 hour
format and vice versa.

Ideally we expect a one-liner.

Example 1:
	Input: 05:15 pm or 05:15pm
	Output: 17:15

Example 2:
	Input: 19:15
	Output: 07:15 pm or 07:15pm
"

My notes: very simple, I like one liners.  In ch-1.sh, you'll see 2 slightly
different versions, both with decent error checking.


Task 2: "Triangle Sum

You are given a triangle array.

Write a script to find the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

When you are on index i on the current row then you may move to either
index i or index i + 1 on the next row.

Example 1:
	Input: Triangle = [ [1], [2,4], [6,4,9], [5,1,7,2] ]
	Output: 8

Explanation: The given triangle

            1
           2 4
          6 4 9
         5 1 7 2

The minimum path sum from top to bottom:  1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 8

             [1]
           [2]  4
           6 [4] 9
          5 [1] 7 2

Example 2:

	Input: Triangle = [ [3], [3,1], [5,2,3], [4,3,1,3] ]
	Output: 7

Explanation: The given triangle

            3
           3 1
          5 2 3
         4 3 1 3

The minimum path sum from top to bottom: 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7

             [3]
            3  [1]
           5 [2] 3
          4 3 [1] 3



"

My notes: nice question.
