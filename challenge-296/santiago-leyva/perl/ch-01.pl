You are given a string of alphabetic characters, $chars.

Write a script to compress the string with run-length encoding, as shown in the examples.

A compressed unit can be either a single character or a count followed by a character.

BONUS: Write a decompression function.

Example 1
Input: $chars = "abbc"
Output: "a2bc"
Example 2
Input: $chars = "aaabccc"
Output: "3ab3c"
Example 3
Input: $chars = "abcc"
Output: "ab2c"
