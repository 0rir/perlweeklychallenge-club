#         Disjoint Sets
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given two sets with unique integers.
# 
#         Write a script to figure out if they are disjoint.
# 
#         The two sets are disjoint if they donâ€™t have any common members.
# 
#         Example
#             Input: @S1 = (1, 2, 5, 3, 4)
#                    @S2 = (4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
#             Output: 0 as the given two sets have common member 4.
#     
#             Input: @S1 = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
#                    @S2 = (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
#             Output: 1 as the given two sets do not have common member.

#         method:
# 
#             when we say "Set" what we mean here in Perl is an array of
#             unique elements. They could be numbers, but as we're going to
#             stringify them in the end really most anything that can be a
#             hash key will will do.
