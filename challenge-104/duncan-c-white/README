Task 1: "FUSC Sequence

Write a script to generate first 50 members of FUSC Sequence. Please
refer to http://oeis.org/A002487 for more information.

The sequence defined as below:

	fusc(0) = 0
	fusc(1) = 1

for n > 1:
	when n is even: fusc(n) = fusc(n / 2),
	when n is odd: fusc(n) = fusc((n-1)/2) + fusc((n+1)/2)
"

My notes: looks like a case for Memoize to make this highly recursive
function efficient.  No, turns out it's quite efficient, so we don't
even need Memoize!


Task 2: "NIM Game

Write a script to simulate the NIM Game.

It is played between 2 players. For the purpose of this task, let assume
you play against the machine.

There are 3 simple rules to follow:

a) You have 12 tokens
b) Each player can pick 1, 2 or 3 tokens at a time
c) The player who picks the last token wins the game
"

My notes: damn!  I was really looking forward to this, but THAT'S NOT
NIM!  That's a similar "simple take away game" as described here:
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/comb.pdf
(although that starts with 21 tokens, not 12).
