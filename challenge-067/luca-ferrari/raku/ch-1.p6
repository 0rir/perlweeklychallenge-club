# Task 1
# You are given two integers $m and $n. Write a script print all possible combinations of $n numbers from the list 1 2 3 â€¦ $m.
#
# Every combination should be sorted i.e. [2,3] is valid combination but [3,2] is not.

    my @combinations;

    for @digits -> $start {

        # build the array of combinations starting with the
        # current digits, place another one that is increased by one
