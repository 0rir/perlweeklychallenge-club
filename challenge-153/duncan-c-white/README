TASK #1 - Triangle Sum Path

You are given a triangle array.

Write a script to find the minimum sum path from top to bottom.

Example 1:

	Input: $triangle = [ [1], [5,3], [2,3,4], [7,1,0,2], [6,4,5,2,8] ]

			1
		       5 3
		      2 3 4
		     7 1 0 2
		    6 4 5 2 8

	Output: 8

	    Minimum Sum Path = 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 2 => 8

Example 2:

	Input: $triangle = [ [5], [2,3], [4,1,5], [0,1,2,3], [7,2,4,1,9] ]

			5
		       2 3
		      4 1 5
		     0 1 2 3
		    7 2 4 1 9

	Output: 9

	    Minimum Sum Path = 5 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 => 9

MY NOTES: So it appears at each row, we simply pick the minimum value.
It doesn't have to be adjacent, or even close to, the one we picked
on the row above.  Ok, so that's easy!  Actually, parsing the input
may be the hardest part.


TASK #2 - Rectangle Area

You are given coordinates bottom-left and top-right corner of two rectangles in a 2D plane.

Write a script to find the total area covered by the two rectangles.

Example 1:

	Input: Rectangle 1 => (-1,0), (2,2)
	       Rectangle 2 => (0,-1), (4,4)

	Output: 22

Example 2:

	Input: Rectangle 1 => (-3,-1), (1,3)
	       Rectangle 2 => (-1,-3), (2,2)

	Output: 25

MY NOTES: Of course the tricky bit here is when the rectangles overlap.
