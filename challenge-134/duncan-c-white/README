TASK #1 - Pandigital Numbers

Write a script to generate first 5 Pandigital Numbers in base 10.

As per the wikipedia, it says:

A pandigital number is an integer that in a given base has among its
significant digits each digit used in the base at least once.
The smallest base 10 pandigital number is 1023456789, and subsequent
ones are lexicographic permutations, ie. 1023456798, 1023456879...

MY NOTES: Basically just needs a standard lexicographic permutation algorithm,
with the initial value to permute being 1023456789.

TASK #2 - Distinct Terms Count

You are given 2 positive numbers, $m and $n.

Write a script to generate multiplication table and display count of distinct terms.

Example 1

Input: $m = 3, $n = 3
Output:

      x | 1 2 3
      --+------
      1 | 1 2 3
      2 | 2 4 6
      3 | 3 6 9

Distinct Terms: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
Count: 6

Example 2

Input: $m = 3, $n = 5
Output:

      x | 1  2  3  4  5
      --+--------------
      1 | 1  2  3  4  5
      2 | 2  4  6  8 10
      3 | 3  6  9 12 15

Distinct Terms: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15
Count: 11


MY NOTES: Pretty easy, the distinct terms just need a set (hash) as usual.
The tricky bit is the pretty layout of the multiplication table, especially
getting the correct column widths..
