TASK #2 â€º Square-free Integer
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

Write a script to generate all square-free integers <= 500.

  | In mathematics, a square-free integer (or squarefree integer) is an 
  | integer which is divisible by no perfect square other than 1. That 
  | is, its prime factorization has exactly one factor for each prime 
  | that appears in it. For example, 10 = 2 x 5 is square-free, but 
  | 18 = 2 x 3 x 3 is not, because 18 is divisible by 9 = 3**2.
