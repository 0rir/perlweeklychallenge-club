Task 1: Sentence Order

You are given a paragraph.

Write a script to order each sentence alphanumerically and print the
whole paragraph.

Example

Input:
    All he could think about was how it would all end. There was
    still a bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics
    were there for anyone to see. No matter how much he tried to
    see the positive, it wasn't anywhere to be seen. The end was
    coming and it wasn't going to be pretty.

Output:
    about All all could end he how it think was would. a anyone
    basics bit but equation, for in of see still the the There
    there to uncertainty was were. anywhere be he how it matter
    much No positive, see seen the to to tried wasn't. and be
    coming end going it pretty The to was wasn't.

MY NOTES: hmm, sounds surprisingly tricky, we have to read all the input,
identify all the sentences (a sentence can span multiple lines), for each
sentence split off the trailing '. ', sort the words in the sentence in
case-insensitive order, add the '. ' back again, accumulate all the
output words in a single array, and then print it out with width formatting.
Stole width formatting code from challenge 177.


Task 2: Hot Day

You are given file with daily temperature record in random order.
Write a script to find out days hotter than previous day.

Example

Input File: (temperature.txt)

2022-08-01, 20
2022-08-09, 10
2022-08-03, 19
2022-08-06, 24
2022-08-05, 22
2022-08-10, 28
2022-08-07, 20
2022-08-04, 18
2022-08-08, 21
2022-08-02, 25

Output:
2022-08-02
2022-08-05
2022-08-06
2022-08-08
2022-08-10

MY NOTES: looks pretty easy (easier than first task).  Could parse dates, but
technically as the dates are all ISO dates, they can be sorted as strings.
